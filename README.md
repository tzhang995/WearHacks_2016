Marco Polo for Pebble Watches.

The watch screen displays the approximate metre distance to the other watch, buzzing with higher frequency as you get closer.

The watches use the longitude/latitude data from a paired phone, communicating to each other over a firebase server.

##Set up
1. Link Pebble with a phone.
2. Download the wearhacks/build/wearhacks.pbw file, and transfer it to your phone.
3. Navigate to the pwb on your phone via a file explorer. It will give you the option to add it as an app to the Pebble.
4. Open the app on two Pebbles.

The rest is simple - Discover displays your approximate distance to the other watch.

The closer the distance, the more frequent the buzzes.
