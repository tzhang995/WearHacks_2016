Be Amazed with the World Around You

Some people have this misconception that technology confines us, that the more technology does, the less we humans will do. But that is not the case, humans have always had the need to explore, to find new and interesting things to do. And to help push that idea further, we have a new, revolutionary app designed to feed the human's urge to explore.  
Introducing Discover, a Pebble smart watch app that pulls coordinates from FireBase, a real-time cloud server, and navigates the user to where ever they want to go. As you get closer to your location, your watch will vibrate more intensely, alerting you that you are closer to your target destination. With our carefully analyzed algorithm, we guarantee new and interesting things for you to find.  
With this technology, exploring new things in life will be as easy as wearing a watch. From the childhood nostalgic game of hide-and-go-seek to an adrenaline rushing game of geo-caching, the posibilities are for you to discover.

##Set up
1. Link Pebble with a phone.
2. Download the git repository.
3. Change the firebase from ours to your own
4. Build the app and upload the pwb file and install it on your phone
5. Navigate to the pwb on your phone via a file explorer. It will give you the option to add it as an app to the Pebble.
6. Open the app on two Pebbles.

The rest is simple - Discover displays your approximate distance to the other watch.

The closer the distance, the more frequent the buzzes.
